# DatabaseProject
A simplified hospital management system built in SQL for a university project. It includes tables for patients, staff, appointments, and treatments, with relationships and basic queries for organizing medical data.

🏥 Hospital Management System – Database Project (Semester 1 , second year)
This project is a basic hospital management system developed as part of the university course in database systems (Semester 1). It focuses on the relational database design, data integrity, and SQL querying techniques used in a simplified hospital environment.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of the project was to simulate a hospital’s internal structure and operations using a relational database. It includes the definition of key entities such as patients, doctors, appointments, departments, and treatments, as well as the relationships between them.

💾 Technologies Used
MySQL / Oracle SQL
SQL DDL (CREATE TABLE, ALTER)
SQL DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
Basic Views and Joins
Normalization (up to 3NF)

🧩 Main Features
Creating and managing the hospital’s structure (units, rooms, staff, etc.)
Patient registration and tracking
Scheduling appointments and assigning doctors
Tracking treatments and associated data
Basic statistical queries for reporting

📚 Learning Outcomes
Designing normalized relational databases
Understanding one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
